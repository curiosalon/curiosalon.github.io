So it's late at night, 3:20 AM to be exact as I type these words and I've been
trying to think of what to put here.  Well, late nights are hardly something
that is new for me.  I've had a bizarre sleep schedule for over a decade now
and tonight is no exception. So in my attempt to introduce myself via this 
About section of this hole in the wall of a website, I think it makes sense to
share a bit about what the world is like for me as I write.


My desk is cluttered with miscellaneous accoutrements of the computer nerd.
For starters my desk is not a desk, rather it's a square dining table that was
purchased from Ikea sometime in the last two decades. Two screens that
were reasonably good way back in 2011 when I bought them originally are my 
windows to the world in this rural village that I find myself living nowadays.
The *desk* has endured a fair amount of wear since I sit at this infernal
machine every single day, without fail, and engage with my friends, work on
projects or generally goof around.


Also on the desk, besides the mouse and keyboard with which I type these words
is a small bottle of antacid tablets for my semi regular indigestion and some
eye drops for an odd medical condition I've experienced with one of my eyes
over the last year or two. The eye thing is better now, I think, but I keep
eye drops around incase it comes back. Under the antacid tablets I see a
card that my elderly father wrote for me last christmas (it's April now and 
the card won't be leaving the desk any time soon).  The card reads:

> Dear Son
>
> I listen to you speaking with your friends and I can hear the power that you
> are.
>
> Love Dad

He's proud of me, my Dad. Like I know it says in his own writing there on the
card that he loves me, but honestly only now as I sit writing here am I really
in touch with that communication. I'm actually moved almost to tears in
appreciation of it.

Huh. When I started writing this page, I didn't really know where this was
going to go but yeah, this is what it is and I'm going to go with it. I see
this website as a way for me to share a bit of my life and create hopefully
a bit of income down the road but for now, as I write, it's a way
for me to say I love you too Dad.
