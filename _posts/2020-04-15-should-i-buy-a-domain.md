Professionalism. Does this matter, like seriously, does it really matter. I'm
creating this website/blog/thing and I've wondered if I should splash
a bit of my cash and throw it into purchasing a domain name. In
theory I would like to "monetize" or eventually generate at least some income
from whatever work I put into this website, and if I do, I keep thinking to
myself, "I should buy a domain name".  It's the kind of thing I've always done
in the past, new projects get new domains, new email addresses, maybe even
throw some money at google or Microsoft and pay for services like Apps or
exchange.

So far though, this thing, whatever this thing may be, is just me sitting at
my computer and pouring my stream of conciousness into the keyboard hoping
that something readable will appear at the other side.

Domain names, although they don't cost a lot, also do not cost nothing and
in the era of extremely powerful search engines it probably doesn't actually
matter whether a domain name is relevant, usually.

For instance if I was to search on Google for a topic, lets say, "Using github
to publish a website for free", what would I get?

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/publish-to-github-free.png"
alt="Instructions to publish a free website using github" 
caption="Instructions to publish a free website using github" %}

Did their domain name help them get found by the google algorithm?

No.  Medium.com is as average or esoteric a name as any other, but rather
what enabled them to be found as the top search result is a combination the
content of their page (I read it, it is superb), and a non trivial amount of
attention put to creating usable, readable, and searchable content with all
those juicy keywords that search engines love to chew on.

So, here's my thoughts.  I don't think it makes a damn bit of difference in
the current year to buy a domain or whatever. Certainly for hole in the wall
websites like this one.  Ideally, I guess that a niche website that is trying
genuinely to make a name for itself inside of its field it would help at
in some way to give the search engines that little extra kick in the butt to
push them towards one bit of content over another, but you know what, for me
I simply just don't care.
